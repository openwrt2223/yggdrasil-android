Updated core library to 0.5.7, presenting these changes:

Added
WebSocket support for peerings, by using the new ws:// scheme in Listen and Peers
Additionally, the wss:// scheme can be used to connect to a WebSocket peer behind a HTTPS reverse proxy

Changed
On Linux, the TUN adapter now uses vectorised reads/writes where possible, which should reduce the amount of CPU time spent on syscalls and potentially improve throughput
Link error handling has been improved and various link error messages have been rewritten to be clearer
Upgrade dependencies

Fixed
Multiple multicast connections to the same remote machine should now work correctly
You may get two connections in some cases, one inbound and one outbound, this is known and will not cause problems
